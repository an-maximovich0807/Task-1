What I've learnt from the ocean
Hard to dance and rejoice in the motion
Let the sun have its moment
The moon will come
What I've learnt from a soldier
Every man is a son to a daughter
And we only remember
When we see the blood

Don't grow up on me
Keep that backstroke in your Afro
Don't you grow up on me
Slow up homie
Don't you grow up on me
Keep it OG sipping slowly
Don't you grow up on me
Slow up homie

Don't you show off on me
Don't you grow up on me
Show off on me...
